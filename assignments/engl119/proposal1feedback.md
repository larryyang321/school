Dear Group:

Your proposal identifies the deliverable your group intends to present to your stakeholders, and how it will be usable. To improve your proposal, explain in more detail how the specific aspects of the product will help your stakeholders. As we discussed in class, your stakeholders are UW students: how does your product fill a gap in the market? What specific needs do the stakeholders have that your product will provide? Additionally, more detail is required in terms of the product you will present to your stakeholders, as well as a clearer discussion on how your team will accomplish the task ahead of you. Avoid using non-specific language: if your product makes people?s lives easier, then how does it do this, and why is it important for your audience? In terms of writing style, avoid colloquial (informal) language. Proofread work to prevent comma errors, passive sentence construction, faulty parallelism, and questionable hyphen use. In formal writing, avoid ?you?; use objective language. Also, what is your group name? In future emails, please cc your group members so I may respond to your entire group.

A good start! Grade 75%

Best,

Christine

\section*{Question 1}
We implemented BFS by visiting each node in BFS-search order and only visiting new nodes if we had not yet visited them and they were valid nodes (eg. within the confines of the maze and not blocked).

We implemented DFS by visiting each node in DFS-search order and only visiting new nodes if we had not yet visited them and they were valid nodes (eg. within the confines of the maze and not blocked).

We implemented A-Star by visiting each node in BFS-search order after applying a heuristic algorithm and only visiting new nodes if we had not yet visited them and they were valid nodes (eg. within the confines of the maze and not blocked). This heuristic algorithm used the Euclidean distance between potential and target nodes as the expected cost since this function is informed and admissible (we can not move diagonally).

\end{lstlisting}

\subsection*{Modifying the Tabu List Size}
Reducing the tabu list size affects the results so long as the size of the tabu list is less than the total number of iterations. When the tabu list size is larger than the number of iterations, changing this value does not change the results.
\begin{lstlisting}[breaklines=true]
Size = 5
[[1, 17, 5, 10, 3], [4, 7, 12, 2, 6], [11, 8, 20, 19, 18], [16, 9, 15, 14, 13]] 2794

Size = 10
[[17, 9, 5, 6, 3], [4, 7, 12, 2, 10], [11, 8, 20, 14, 18], [16, 1, 15, 19, 13]] 2876

Size = 15
[[17, 9, 5, 6, 3], [4, 7, 12, 2, 10], [11, 8, 20, 14, 18], [16, 1, 15, 19, 13]] 2876
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection*{Randomizing the Tabu List Size}
Randomizing the size of the tabu list somewhat randomizes the results.
\begin{lstlisting}[breaklines=true]
Size = rand(0, 5)
[[17, 1, 5, 18, 3], [4, 12, 7, 2, 10], [11, 8, 20, 15, 6], [16, 9, 14, 19, 13]] 2726
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection*{Aspiration Criteria}
When using the aspiration criteria ``best seen so far'', we get a slightly better result of:
\begin{lstlisting}[breaklines=true]
[[17, 1, 5, 18, 3], [4, 7, 15, 2, 6], [11, 8, 20, 19, 10], [16, 12, 13, 14, 9]] 2664
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection*{Smaller Neighbourhood}
Using a smaller neightbourhood gives us worse results but reduces our runtime.
\begin{lstlisting}[breaklines=true]
Neighbourhood = 20
[[9, 5, 3, 6, 13], [1, 7, 12, 10, 20], [17, 4, 8, 2, 15], [16, 11, 14, 18, 19]] 2748
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection*{Encourage Diversification}
Using a frequency-based Tabu list length, we get a different result.
\begin{lstlisting}[breaklines=true]
[[6, 5, 10, 3, 17], [13, 1, 12, 14, 19], [7, 20, 8, 2, 15], [9, 4, 11, 18, 16]] 2804
\end{lstlisting}

\section*{Question 4}
\subsection*{Part A}
\subsubsection*{Part i}
The suitable solution representation is an $m$-length list containing the routes each vehicle should take.

\subsubsection*{Part ii}
A suitable neighbourhood operator would be moving a city from any position in one route to any position in either a different route or the same route such that the resulting paths are not identical.

\subsubsection*{Part iii}
The objective function would be the sum of the travel costs and service costs of each vehicle's route, all summed together.

\subsection*{Part B}
Our suitable solution set and neighbourhood operator would both change to efffectively blacklist any options such that the cost of the travel time on any route exceeds $T$.

\section*{Question 5}
My results were -- in all cases -- worse than the optimal answers. This is likely mostly related to the lack of temperature tuning, lack of alpha-value tuning, and low iteration count. Additionally, it is possible that we use a different cost calculation that the sample data -- the documentation was unclear as to their exact Euclidean distance calculation.

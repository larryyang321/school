Hamlet the Rapist, to his Victim
================================

Now we are alone.
Oh, what a sweet and pleasant slave have I!
Is it not wondrous that this player here,
As if in a fiction, a dream of passion,
Could force your soul to my own conceit
That, from your waking, your visage wanned,
Tears in your eyes, destruction in your aspect,
A broken voice, broken body, and your whole function
Serving only my conceit – all for me!
For Hamlet!
It is Hamlet to you, and you to Hamlet,
That you should weep so. [pause] What would you do
If you had the means and the time to bring suffering
As I have? Would you drown the world in tears,
cleave my ear with horrid speech?
Or confound me and amaze indeed,
Destroying the very faculties of my eyes and ears? Yet I,
A humble and weak rascal, harmless
like John-a-dreams, pregnant of my cause
can make you do nothing – no, not for yourself
Though your property and most dear life
Shall be damned. Are you a coward?
You call me “villain”, but would you break my pate across?
Pluck my beard and blow it in my face?
Tweak me by the nose? Hit me i' th' throat
As deep as my lungs? Would you do this?
Ha! Were it true, I should take it! But it cannot be.
You are pigeon-livered and lack gall
And so make this oppression bitter, or ere this prison
Should have failed, and you should have shouted
To all this region's kites: “Bloody, bawdy villain!
Remorseless, treacherous, lecherous, kindless villain is he!
Oh, vengeance!” [she cries]
Why, what an ass am I! This is most brave
That I, the son of my dear father,
Prompted to rave and gloat by heaven and hell
Upon a whore, whose heart and words
Are packed within. You drab!
You scullion! Fie upon you! Foh!
Quiet, I say! - Hum, I have heard
Of guilty creatures, awaiting play,
Who have, by  the very languish of their hearts
Been struck to the soul so
And have envisioned malefactions of no truth.
For murder, though it hath no body, will walk
With most miraculous speed. And these creatures,
Their souls set in most self-aimed slaughter,
Wouldst deny it. But I'll protect your locks;
I'll stop thy soul's anguish. If you do blench,
I'll stop this course. But the spirit I have seen
May be a devil in white dress, and the devil hath power
To be a pleasing shape; yea, and perhaps,
Out of your weakness and melancholy,
As is the very portrait of your visage,
Will consent to the abuse and damnation. I'd have grounds
More interesting than this: Thy life's final toll
Willst bring with it the loss of your soul.

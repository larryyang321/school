The Willows Shiver
==================

Often, the willows shake and shiver
Huddle together, hide from the cold winter wind
Crouch as one under the cackling storm
And even fall, when all is lost --
And are torn away by Winter.

Sometimes, Nature hides, too, takes with her her creatures
Her sons, daughters, all who frolicked before
Are gone, hidden:
Under the white hills,
Inside the deep caves,
Within the frigid trees;
No creature would invite the willows' fate.

Rarely, Winter abstains from his brutal duty
He lounges in it, loves it,
Sees the brutal suffering, and smiles;
The wild rampage, and grins;
Winter dances as the willows shiver
And always returns

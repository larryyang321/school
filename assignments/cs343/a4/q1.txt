      | 1 task          | 2 tasks         | 4 tasks
HEAP  | 101.90u 1:41.84 | 967.47u 8:04.75 | 5921.72u 27:30.74
STACK |   3.58u 0:03.57 |   7.31u 0:03.65 |   15.97u  0:04.08

> Explain the relative differences in the timing results with respect to scaling
the number of tasks for each version.
Upon adding more tasks, the overall time increases. Furthermore, the user time
becomes approximately equal to real time times the number of tasks.

> Very briefly (2-4 sentences) speculate on the performance between the two
versions.
The heap version likely takes significantly longer because it allocates huge
amounts of memory for each iteration. The stack version, on the other hand, only
needs to allocate a single pointer.
